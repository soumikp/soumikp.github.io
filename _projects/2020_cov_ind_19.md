Ever since COVID-19 became part of our lives, I have been involved with a group of researchers from the University of Michigan, Johns Hopkins University, Harvard University, Imperial College London, and other institutions from India, the UK, and the US to study and model infectious diseases. Specifically, I have been interested in the spatio-temporal forecasting of infectious diseases. 

Among many other challenges in improving health disparities, COVID-19 was a stark reminder of how underprepared humanity is, in terms of informing and protecting those with an elevated risk of illnesses during a pandemic. I hope that through collaborative research, we have an improved understanding of how diseases spread and have differential impacts on many communities.
