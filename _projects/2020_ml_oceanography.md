One of my earliest collaborations was with a group of researchers from India who study trends in fish harvesting and its impact on aquatic life in the eastern part of India. I wrote software for implementing a Bayesian time series model that was successful in detecting change points in fish catch data in Eastern India. Since a lot of coastal communities in India rely heavily on fishing as the primary source of income, being able to predict fish catch is critical for advising policymakers on labour allocation as well as providing additional support during times of reduced fish catch. This is, in turn, helpful for improving the lives of coastal communities in India. 

My collaborators have helped me not only with analyzing oceanography data but also with understanding the massive impact of climate change on countless fishing villages along the coast of India. I have continued with this collaboration and am actively involved with a new machine learning-based project for time series forecasting of fish catch data.
