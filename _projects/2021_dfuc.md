The [Diabetes Foot Consortium](https://diabeticfootconsortium.org/) is a multi-centre consortium funded by the NIH. In addition to performing standard statistical data analyses for the consortium, I have built a web-based dashboard that allows clinicians to access and download graphical and summary statistics associated with the study. In this dashboard, I was able to automate some data pooling and analysis pipelines, allowing for faster sharing of findings within the group.
