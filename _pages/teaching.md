<br>
In the summer of 2022, I taught a wonderful cohort of undergraduate trainees at the <a href="https://sph.umich.edu/bdsi/">Big Data Summer Institute</a>, a SIBS program that is hosted by the University of Michigan School of Public Health. All coursework takes place at the school, on the University of Michigan campus in Ann Arbor, Michigan. 

I taught two introductory courses, on linear regression and probability theory. You can find the relevant resources linked below. 
<br>
1. Introduction to linear regression: <a href="https://rpubs.com/soumikp/bdsi2022LinRegSlides">slides</a> and <a href="https://rpubs.com/soumikp/bdsi2022LinRegHandout">handouts</a>.
<br>
2. Introduction to probability theory: <a href="https://rpubs.com/soumikp/bdsi2022ProbSlides">slides</a> and <a href="https://rpubs.com/soumikp/bdsi2022ProbHandout">handouts</a>.
<br>

This Summer Institute in Biostatistics (SIBS) program is sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), grant R25HL147207, with the intent to introduce undergrad students to the field of biostatistics. Courses will include data collected in studies of heart, lung, blood, and sleep disorders. To learn more about our sister programs, please visit the NHLBI SIBS program website.
