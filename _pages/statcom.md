I'm proud to say that my department is home to [STATCOM: Statistics in the Community](https://sph.umich.edu/biostat/statcom/). STATCOM is a community outreach program provided by graduate students at the University of Michigan. The program offers the expertise of graduate students, free of charge, to non-profit governmental and community organizations in the areas of data organization, analysis, and interpretation. I have been very fortunate to find meaningful consulting work with a host of community partners. A few of STATCOM's recent projects include partnerships with 

- The [Michigan Center for Youth Justice (MCYJ)](https://www.miyouthjustice.org): STATCOM's partnership with the MCYJ revolves around understanding the patterns of special investigations and violations occurring in juvenile justice facilities throughout the state.
- The [Detroit Housing Commission (DHC)](https://www.dhcmi.org) and [Poverty Solutions (PS)](https://poverty.umich.edu): STATCOM has been working with the DHC and PS to investigate evictions among families with children in Detroit, in order to reduce accompanied as well as unaccompanied youth homelessness rates.
- [Stand with Trans (SWT)](https://standwithtrans.org): STATCOM is collaborating with SWT with the aim of identifying gaps in, and further improving online resources that are designed to empower and support transgender youth. 

Since 2022, I have been serving as Co-president of STATCOM. It has been both challenging as well as rewarding. I expect to continue with STATCOM until I graduate from the university.
