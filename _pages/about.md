## About my work
I am a graduate student in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.linkedin.com/in/soumik-purkayastha-a74989205/) at the [University of Michigan](www.umich.edu). In Fall 2021, I started my third year here in [Ann Arbor](https://www.annarbor.org). 

My methodological interests include (and are not restricted to) Bayesian methods, causal inference and semi/non-parametric approaches. I love challenges in statistical computing and spend most of my time rubber-ducking my code to myself. 

As of August 2020, I am a member of [Peter Song's](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/song-peter.html) [research group](http://websites.umich.edu/~songlab/) where my research focuses on understanding and developing methods motivated by problems arising in the statistical analyses of networks. My recent research has been focused on understanding comorbid mental health outcomes like depression and anxiety. I'm also a part of the [NIH](https://www.nih.gov)-funded multi-centre [Diabetes Foot Consortium](http://diabeticfootconsortium.org) of clinicians and analysts where we study diabetic foot ulcers, a common complication of diabetes and the leading cause of lower limb amputations in the United States.
