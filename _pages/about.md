## About my work
I am a graduate student in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.linkedin.com/in/soumik-purkayastha-a74989205/) at the [University of Michigan](www.umich.edu). In Fall 2021, I started my third year here in [Ann Arbor](https://www.annarbor.org). 

Broadly, I am interested in scaleable and flexible statistical models for design and analysis of biomedical studies and their applications to medical or social science and public policy. The research that I work on include Bayesian methods as well as classical semi- and non-parametric approaches. I love challenges in statistical computing and spend most of my time rubber-ducking my code to myself. 

Over the years I have had extensive experience with C++, Python, R and UNIX. Through my research and internships I have learnt to combine computational expertise with statistical knowledge (e.g. data mining, regression, clustering, decision trees, factor analysis, neural networks) to handle domain-specific problems. I am proficient in working with large data sets 
using strategies like parallelization, MapReduce, and memory-efficient data.  

As of August 2020, I am a member of Dr. [Peter Song's](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/song-peter.html) [research group](http://websites.umich.edu/~songlab/) where my research focuses on understanding and developing methods motivated by problems arising in the statistical analyses of networks. My recent research has been focused on understanding comorbid mental health outcomes like depression and anxiety. I'm also a part of the [NIH](https://www.nih.gov)-funded multi-centre [Diabetes Foot Consortium](http://diabeticfootconsortium.org) of clinicians and analysts where we study diabetic foot ulcers, a common complication of diabetes and the leading cause of lower limb amputations in the United States. Led by Dr. [Cathie Spino](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/spino-cathie.html), my work involves the statistical analyses of ulcer-related wound images.  Since March 2020, I have also been working on studying and modeling the spread of infectious diseases with a [group of statisticians, epidemiologists and economists](https://umich-biostatistics.shinyapps.io/covid19/) led by Dr. [Bhramar Mukherjee](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/mukherjee-bhramar.html).
