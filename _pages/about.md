## About me
I am a graduate student in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.linkedin.com/in/soumik-purkayastha-a74989205/) at the [University of Michigan](www.umich.edu). My interests lie in understanding and developing statistical methods motivated by problems arising from network analyses. Currently my research focuses on understanding asymmetric behaviour in comorbid mental health outcomes like depression and anxiety. Methodologically I am interested in Bayesian methods, causal inference and semi/non-parametric approaches. I love challenges in statistical computing and spend most of my time rubber-ducking my code to myself. 

I am currently a member of [Peter Song's](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/song-peter.html) [research group](http://websites.umich.edu/~songlab/) in addition to being part of a [consortium](http://diabeticfootconsortium.org) of clinicians and analysts interested in developing statistical methods to analyse images of diabetes foot ulcers in patients within the US.
