## About my work

I am a graduate student in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://sph.umich.edu/biostat/) at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/). In Fall 2022, I started my fourth year here in [Ann Arbor](https://www.annarbor.org).

Broadly, I am interested in scaleable and flexible statistical models for design and analysis of biomedical studies and their applications to medical or social science and public policy. The research that I work on include Bayesian methods as well as classical semi- and non-parametric approaches. I love challenges in statistical computing and spend most of my time rubber-ducking my code to myself.

Over the years I have had extensive experience with C++, Python, R and UNIX. Through my research and internships I have learnt to combine computational expertise with statistical knowledge (e.g. data mining, regression, clustering, decision trees, factor analysis, neural networks) to handle domain-specific problems. I am proficient in working with large data sets using strategies like parallelization, MapReduce, and memory-efficient data.

As of August 2020, I am a member of Dr. [Peter Song's](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/song-peter.html) [research group](http://websites.umich.edu/~songlab/) where my research focuses on understanding and developing methods motivated by problems arising in the statistical analyses of networks. My recent research has been focused on understanding comorbid mental health outcomes like depression and anxiety. I'm also a part of the [NIH](https://www.nih.gov)-funded multi-centre [Diabetes Foot Consortium](http://diabeticfootconsortium.org) of clinicians and analysts where we study diabetic foot ulcers, a common complication of diabetes and the leading cause of lower limb amputations in the United States. Led by Dr. [Cathie Spino](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/spino-cathie.html), my work involves the statistical analyses of ulcer-related wound images. Since March 2020, I have also been working on studying and modeling the spread of infectious diseases with a [group of statisticians, epidemiologists and economists](https://umich-biostatistics.shinyapps.io/covid19/) led by Dr. [Bhramar Mukherjee](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/mukherjee-bhramar.html).

## Other stuff

I used to sketch and take photographs on my [Canon 600D](https://www.canon.co.uk/for_home/product_finder/cameras/digital_slr/eos_600d/) in college but as is the case with a lot of students, those took a backseat once I started graduate school. One of my 2022 resolutions is to try and pursue things outside my research that excite me just as much. You can find recent sketches and photographs on my [Instagram profile](https://www.instagram.com/penguinhologram/) - hope you like them! 

## STATCOM 

I'm proud to say that my department is home to [STATCOM: Statistics in the Community](https://sph.umich.edu/biostat/statcom/). STATCOM is a community outreach program provided by graduate students at the University of Michigan. The program offers the expertise of graduate students, free of charge, to non-profit governmental and community organizations in the areas of data organization, analysis, and interpretation. I have been very fortunate to find meaningful consulting work with a host of community partners. A few of STATCOM's recent projects include partnerships with 

- The [Michigan Center for Youth Justice (MCYJ)](https://www.miyouthjustice.org): STATCOM's partnership with the MCYJ revolves around understanding the patterns of special investigations and violations occurring in juvenile justice facilities throughout the state.
- The [Detroit Housing Commission (DHC)](https://www.dhcmi.org) and [Poverty Solutions (PS)](https://poverty.umich.edu): STATCOM has been working with the DHC and PS to investigate evictions among families with children in Detroit, in order to reduce accompanied as well as unaccompanied youth homelessness rates.
- [Stand with Trans (SWT)](https://standwithtrans.org): STATCOM is collaborating with SWT with the aim of identifying gaps in, and further improving online resources that are designed to empower and support transgender youth. 

Since 2022, I have been serving as Co-president of STATCOM. It has been both challenging as well as rewarding. I expect to continue with STATCOM until I graduate from the university.
