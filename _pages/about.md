I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Biostatistics and Health Data Science](https://www.sph.pitt.edu/biostatistics) at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu). In the summer of 2024, I graduated from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor with a Ph.D. in Biostatistics.

## ðŸ“– Research

Broadly, I am interested in scaleable and flexible statistical models for design and analysis of biomedical studies and their applications to medical or social science and public policy. The research that I work on include Bayesian methods as well as classical semi- and non-parametric approaches. I love challenges in statistical computing and spend most of my time rubber-ducking my code to myself.
