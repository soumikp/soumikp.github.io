I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Biostatistics and Health Data Science](https://www.sph.pitt.edu/biostatistics) at the [University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health](https://www.publichealth.pitt.edu). In the summer of 2024, I graduated from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor with a Ph.D. in Biostatistics.

In addition to my role at Pitt Public Health, I work as a Research Biostatistician at the [Center for Health Equity Research and Promotion, Department of Veteran Affairs](https://www.cherp.research.va.gov) where I am part of an interdisciplinary team of doctors, researchers, clinicians and scholars advancing the quality and equity of health and health care for veterans.

## ðŸ“– Research

Broadly, I am interested in scaleable and flexible statistical models for design and analysis of biomedical studies and their applications to medical or social science and public policy. The research that I work on include Bayesian methods as well as classical semi- and non-parametric approaches. I love challenges in statistical computing and spend most of my time rubber-ducking my code to myself.

My current research interests include: 

1. **Information-theoretic framework for association and causality**: development of statistical methods for studying association and causality without relying on traditional causal inference assumptions, with applications in areas like mediation analysis and instrumental variables.
2. **Compartmental models for infectious disease modeling**: development of spatiotemporal forecasting techniques to study transmission and fallout of infectious diseases, with specific emphasis on COVID-19.
