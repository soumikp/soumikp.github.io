I am a graduate student in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://sph.umich.edu/biostat/) at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/). In the fall of 2023 I started my fifth (and final ðŸ¤ž) year here in [Ann Arbor](https://www.annarbor.org).

## ðŸ“£ News

-  2023.12.14 - My paper on [Generative causality: using Shannon's information theory to infer underlying asymmetry in causal relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04696) is now available on arXiv! <details>*In this paper, I propose a new framework where any causal link between putative cause and effect is generated by asymmetric information flow from one variable to another. Using an entropy-based coefficient, I capture said asymmetry in observational studies.*</details>
- 2023.11.29 - My paper on [fastMI: a fast and consistent copula-based nonparametric estimator of mutual information](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0047259X23001161) is published by the Journal of Multivariate Analysis! <details>*In this paper, we develop a consistent and powerful estimator, called fastMI outperforms state-of-the-art estimators of MI with improved estimation accuracy and reduced run time for large data sets.*</details>
- 2023.11.07 - A technical report on [Asymmetric predictability in causal discovery: an information theoretic approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14455) is now available on arXiv! <details>*In this report, we present and information geometric causal discovery framework of "predictive asymmetry" to unearth latent directionality in data coming from observational studies.*</details>

## ðŸ“– Research

Broadly, I am interested in scaleable and flexible statistical models for design and analysis of biomedical studies and their applications to medical or social science and public policy. The research that I work on include Bayesian methods as well as classical semi- and non-parametric approaches. I love challenges in statistical computing and spend most of my time rubber-ducking my code to myself.

Over the years I have had extensive experience with C++, Python, R and UNIX. Through my research and internships I have learnt to combine computational expertise with statistical knowledge (e.g. data mining, regression, clustering, decision trees, factor analysis, neural networks) to handle domain-specific problems. I am proficient in working with large data sets using strategies like parallelization, MapReduce, and memory-efficient data.
